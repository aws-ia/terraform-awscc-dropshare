# Security Policy

This document describes the management of vulnerabilities and security concerns for this Terraform module.

## Supported Versions

In order to enable a healthy ecosystem, we will support the following versions:

* currently released version
* last previously released version
* any upcoming pre-release versions

Older versions _may_ receive updates, if deemed necessary - such evaluation will happen on a case-by-case basis.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please contact the [CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/aws-ia/terraform-awscc-dropshare/blob/main/CODEOWNERS) if you have a potential security vulnerability or concern to report.
